      <p>The main feature of Online Doctor appointment system is to provide the browser to get appointments from a doctor through internet instead of going there and fixing an appointment.</p>
      <p> Everyone needs to have Medical attention at any time. So we allow every user to register freely at any time..</p>
      <p>We also maintain patients prescriptions so that their medical details are always available on Internet, which will be more convenient for the patients.</p>
